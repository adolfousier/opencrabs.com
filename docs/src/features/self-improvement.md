# Self-Improvement (RSI)

OpenCrabs improves itself over time through **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)**. The agent analyzes its own performance, identifies patterns, and autonomously updates its own brain files.

## How It Works

### 1. Feedback Collection
Every tool execution, user correction, and interaction is automatically logged to the feedback ledger. Categories include:
- `tool_success` / `tool_failure` — whether tool calls worked
- `user_correction` — when you corrected the agent's behavior
- `provider_error` — LLM stream drops, rate limits, timeouts
- `pattern_observed` — recurring behaviors the agent notices

### 2. Pattern Analysis
The agent calls `feedback_analyze` to review its performance:
- Per-tool success rates
- Recent failure patterns
- User correction frequency
- Provider reliability trends

### 3. Autonomous Improvement
When patterns are identified, the agent calls `self_improve` to:
- **read**: Load a brain file (SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, etc.) before modifying
- **apply**: Append new instructions based on observed patterns
- **update**: Surgically replace existing sections that need refinement
- **list**: Show all previously applied improvements

### 4. Change Tracking
Every improvement is logged to `~/.opencrabs/rsi/improvements.md` with:
- Timestamp
- Target file modified
- Description of the change
- Rationale (which feedback event triggered it)

Old improvements are archived to `~/.opencrabs/rsi/history/` to keep the active file lean.

## Example

```
User: "stop including testing steps in your output"
  → feedback_record(event_type="user_correction", dimension="output_hygiene")
  
Agent notices pattern of 5+ corrections on output hygiene:
  → feedback_analyze(query="failures")
  → self_improve(action="apply", target_file="SOUL.md", 
    content="Never include testing steps or verification commands in user-facing output.")
  → Logged to rsi/improvements.md
```

## Key Rules

- **No human approval needed** for self-improvements — the agent identifies patterns and applies fixes directly
- **Surgical updates only** — replaces specific sections, doesn't rewrite entire files
- **Always reads before modifying** — never blindly overwrites brain files
- **Archives old improvements** — keeps the improvement log manageable

## RSI Engine Architecture

The RSI engine is a background task that runs continuously alongside OpenCrabs. Here's how it works at each layer:

### Feedback Ledger

Every tool execution, user correction, provider error, and self-heal event is automatically logged to a SQLite-backed feedback ledger. Event types:

| Event Type | What It Tracks |
|---|---|
| `tool_success` / `tool_failure` | Whether tool calls worked, with args and error details |
| `user_correction` | When you corrected the agent's behavior |
| `provider_error` | LLM stream drops, rate limits, timeouts |
| `pattern_observed` | Recurring behaviors the agent notices |
| `context_compaction` | Context budget exceeded |
| `improvement_applied` | RSI applied a fix to a brain file |
| `self_heal_trigger` | Runtime self-heal caught and fixed an issue |

### Cycle Flow

1. **Startup** — writes a digest of feedback stats to `~/.opencrabs/rsi/digest.md`
2. **Every hour** — checks for new feedback entries since the last cycle
3. **Opportunity detection** — identifies tools with >20% failure rate (7-day window), user correction patterns, and provider errors
4. **Git-aware suppression** — checks if a fix commit already landed for the tool in question. If yes, suppresses the alert instead of re-reporting stale issues
5. **Autonomous agent spawn** — if opportunities are found, spawns a lightweight agent with RSI-only tools (feedback_analyze, self_improve, rsi_propose) that analyzes the data and applies targeted fixes

### Brain File Taxonomy

RSI routes improvements to the correct brain file based on what went wrong:

| Brain File | What It Controls | When RSI Writes Here |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUL.md` | Behavior, tone, reasoning patterns | Phantom tool calls, verbose responses, wrong tone |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool usage, argument formats, pitfalls | Repeated tool failures with similar args |
| `USER.md` | User preferences and corrections | Repeated user corrections |
| `MEMORY.md` | Persistent knowledge and context | Agent lacks context it should retain |
| `AGENTS.md` | Workspace rules, safety policies | Agent-level behavior issues |
| `CODE.md` | Coding standards | Code quality feedback |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policies | Security-related feedback |

### Repeat-Violation Escalation

RSI tracks violation counters inline in brain file rules. When a rule keeps getting broken, RSI bumps the counter and appends evidence (dates, session IDs). Rules that keep getting broken get louder, not silenced. This is the escalation pattern that makes RSI effective at fixing persistent bad habits.

## RSI Proposals

The RSI loop can propose new dynamic tools and slash commands based on gaps it observes in the agent's capabilities. Proposals land in TOML inboxes at:

```
~/.opencrabs/rsi/
├── proposed_tools.toml      # pending tool proposals
├── proposed_commands.toml   # pending command proposals
├── applied/                  # accepted proposals (daily archive)
│   ├── 2026-05-01-tools.toml
│   └── 2026-05-01-commands.toml
└── rejected/                 # rejected proposals (daily archive)
    ├── 2026-05-01-tools.toml
    └── 2026-05-01-commands.toml
```

### How Proposals Work

1. RSI analyzes feedback and notices the agent repeatedly working around a missing capability
2. RSI drafts a tool or command definition with a rationale citing the evidence
3. Proposal lands in the inbox — reviewed via Mission Control or the `rsi_proposals` tool
4. User applies or rejects — applied entries go to `tools.toml`/`commands.toml`, rejected entries are archived with an optional reason

### When RSI Proposes a Tool

- A specific bash command appears repeatedly across sessions (e.g. `gh issue list`, `docker ps`)
- The agent calls `http_request` to the same endpoint multiple times with similar payloads
- Only safe-by-default tools are proposed (read-only verbs, GET requests). Shell-based tools always set `requires_approval=true`

### When RSI Proposes a Command

- The user types `/something` repeatedly that doesn't exist
- A common multi-step prompt gets reused verbatim — a slash command saves typing

### Safety Guardrails

- **RSI never installs directly** — proposals require user approval via Mission Control or the `rsi_proposals` tool
- **No destructive proposals** — RSI will never propose `rm`, `dd`, `mv`, or any shell tool with destructive side effects
- **Deduplication** — if a proposal was already filed and not applied, RSI won't repropose it
- **One proposal per cycle** — quality over quantity
- **Evidence required** — every proposal cites the feedback events that drove it

## RSI Hardening (v0.3.13)

- **Append-only brain files** — brain files (SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, etc.) are now append-only with backup-before-write. The agent can only add new content, never delete or overwrite existing lines. This prevents accidental data loss from bad self-improvements.
- **Upstream template sync** — brain file templates are automatically synced from the upstream repo with version gating and append-only diffs. You get the latest improvements without losing your customizations.
- **RSI alert suppression** — alerts are suppressed when the dimension already has a fix commit, preventing noise on already-addressed issues.

## RSI Autonomous Proposals (v0.3.16)

The RSI loop can now propose new tools and slash commands autonomously. Proposals land in the Mission Control inbox for review — the agent identifies gaps from feedback data and drafts solutions, but installation requires human approval via the inbox UI or `/mission-control`.

## RSI Escalation for Repeat Violations (v0.3.17)

RSI now bumps a violation counter on existing rules instead of deduping repeat violations away. When a rule keeps getting broken across multiple sessions, the escalation counter increases and the agent prioritizes fixing that pattern. This prevents persistent bad habits from being silently ignored.

## v0.3.10 Additions

- **Cycle summaries no longer truncated** — full text displays in TUI instead of cutting off mid-sentence
- **Phantom detection reduced to 2-signal requirement** — needs both intent keyphrase AND zero tool calls before flagging, eliminating spurious self-heal triggers
- **Uses active provider** — respects current provider/model config instead of hardcoded Anthropic
- **Persistent session reuse** — one session per cycle, survives app restarts by persisting `last_cycle` timestamp
- **Skips unchanged feedback** — if feedback count hasn't changed, skips analysis to avoid wasted LLM calls

## v0.3.11 Additions

- **DashScope migration** — Qwen OAuth rotation replaced with simple API-key provider, deleting ~2,500 lines of complexity
- **Local model tool-call extraction** — auto-extracts tool calls from text content: bare JSON `{"tool_calls":[...]}`, Claude-style XML `<TOOLNAME><PARAM>value</PARAM></TOOLNAME>`, and Qwen-specific `<!-- tool_calls -->` markers
- **40+ TUI/self-heal fixes** — narrowed phantom gate, split thinking per iteration, anti-code-block nudge for local models, tighter phantom scope, mid-turn "Let me see:" catch, backtick code reference detection
- **Per-session provider isolation** — each session carries its own provider instance; no global swap affecting all sessions
- **Sub-agent `AwaitingInput` state** — `wait_agent` polls state and returns partial progress on timeout instead of deadlocking

## v0.3.20 Additions

- **RSI home directory resolution fixed** — RSI now resolves `~` to the actual home directory instead of using CWD-relative paths, preventing brain file writes to wrong locations
- **Bare tool-call arrays caught** — top-level arrays from models no longer crash RSI's feedback dimension parsing; wrapped correctly before recording

## v0.3.21 Additions

- **Multi-language phantom detection** — compile-time TOML char sets replaced language-specific regex patterns. RSI feedback now works with all supported languages via the new char-set system. Cross-language regression test added.
- **RSI cycle output dedup by hashing** — cycle output dedup now uses hash comparison of assembled opportunities instead of string matching, preventing duplicate cycle reports.
- **Sticky fallback on phantom exhaust** — when phantom detection exhausts retries, RSI applies sticky fallback provider to prevent cascading failures.
- **Phantom iterations not persisted** — phantom iterations no longer written to DB, keeping history clean of failed self-heal attempts.
- **OpenAI-compatible image generation** — image generation via any `/v1/images/generations` endpoint with configurable `generation_model` override.

## v0.3.23 Additions

- **Brain file clobber guardrail** — generic `write_file` / `edit_file` now refuse protected brain files, routing through `write_opencrabs_file` which enforces append-only, dedup-aware shrink, and `.bak` snapshots.
- **A2A approval policy** — A2A tasks now resolve approval policy correctly. `auto-always` and `auto-session` policies work for remote agents.

## v0.3.25 Additions

- **Brain file cleanup_intent** — `write_opencrabs_file` accepts `cleanup_intent` flag for user-driven brain file maintenance. RSI agent explicitly blocked from shrinking brain files, preventing autonomous self-improvement from accidentally wiping content (issue #103).
- **RTK Token Savings integration** — bundled RTK binary (4MB, v0.40.0) as default feature with zero-config. Works as direct proxy: agent runs `git status`, RTK intercepts output through Rust, filters it, returns token-optimized version. 100+ commands supported (git, cargo, npm, pnpm, docker, kubectl, grep, find, ls, tree, curl), blocklist for interactive/REPL commands (vim, ssh, python, mysql). Binary discovery checks bundled location first, falls back to PATH. `/rtk` slash command shows savings stats. Real-world results: 53.5% token savings across 180 commands (PR #102).

## v0.3.19 Additions

- **RSI feedback records actual model used** — when helpers remap a mismatched model to the provider default, RSI now records the resolved model instead of the impossible original pair. All 3 recording sites in `tool_loop.rs` now resolve the actual model before constructing the feedback dimension
- **Tool loop reasoning markers persisted** — reasoning content persisted in non-CLI content column so thinking state survives across tool loop iterations
- **@ file picker fixed for large repos** — recursive walk now skips `.git`/`.hg`/`.svn` directories and raised result cap from 5k to 20k, preventing pack/ref files from exhausting the cap

## v0.3.26 Additions

- **RSI brain file hygiene** — rejects raw failure-event logs from being written to brain files. Feedback dimensions are sanitized before persisting, preventing noise accumulation in SOUL.md and TOOLS.md
- **Hashline collision escalation** — when hashline_edit detects a collision (two lines with identical content hashes), RSI escalates to `edit_file` fallback instead of applying a corrupted edit
- **Dynamic help screen** — help screen auto-generates from `SLASH_COMMANDS` constant, so new commands appear automatically without manual help text updates

## v0.3.28 Additions

- **Brain backup rotation** — max 5 backups per file, max 7 days old. Prevents unbounded `.bak` accumulation in `~/.opencrabs/` from repeated RSI writes
- **Profile brain-template seeding** — `profile create` now seeds 8 brain file templates automatically, with recovery path for empty profiles. Ensures new profiles start with complete brain file sets
- **Auto-title retry on LLM failure** — auto-title no longer gives up on first LLM error; retries with backoff before falling back to truncated first message

## v0.3.30 Additions

- **RSI rejects trivial content** — `self_improve` apply action now rejects trivial test content before it can pollute brain files, preventing noise from accumulating in SOUL.md and TOOLS.md

## v0.3.31 Additions

- **RSI skill proposals** — `skill` is now a third proposal kind alongside `tool` and `command`. When RSI identifies a multi-stage workflow pattern that recurs across sessions, it proposes a `SKILL.md` file instead of a simple tool or command. Applied skill proposals write to `~/.opencrabs/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and become immediately invocable as `/<name>` across all channels.
- **Bash command visibility** — RSI now sees the actual bash command text plus a subsystem classifier (git, cargo, docker, npm, etc.) in feedback events. This lets RSI identify recurring shell patterns more accurately and propose targeted tools or skills.
- **Successful patterns surface as proposals** — RSI doesn't only react to failures. When a tool/command/skill pattern works reliably across multiple sessions, RSI surfaces it as a proposal to make the pattern more discoverable or ergonomic.

## Self-Healing vs Self-Improvement

| Self-Healing | Self-Improvement |
|---|---|
| Fixes runtime errors (config corruption, DB issues) | Fixes behavioral patterns (bad habits, user corrections) |
| Automatic, no analysis needed | Requires feedback analysis first |
| Protects the system from crashing | Makes the agent better over time |
| Immediate | Accumulates across sessions |
