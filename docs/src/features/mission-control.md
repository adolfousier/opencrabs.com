# Mission Control

Mission Control is a full-screen TUI dashboard that brings RSI activity, inbox proposals, and scheduled jobs into one place. Open it with `/mission-control`.

## The Three Panels

The screen is divided into three panels: a large **Inbox** on the left, and **Activity** + **Schedule** stacked on the right.

### Inbox

Pending RSI proposals displayed as cards. Each card shows:
- **Tool proposals** (orange `tool` badge) — new dynamic tools RSI thinks you need, with the shell command template
- **Command proposals** (teal `command` badge) — new slash commands RSI drafted based on usage patterns
- **Skill proposals** — new `SKILL.md` files RSI drafted when it detects a repeated multi-step workflow that isn't covered by an existing skill

Each card shows the proposal name, type badge, description or command template, and how long ago it was proposed.

Apply or reject proposals inline:
- `a` — apply the selected proposal (installs tool/command to config, or creates skill directory)
- `r` — reject the selected proposal (archives with optional reason)

Applied and rejected entries are archived daily to `~/.opencrabs/rsi/applied/` and `~/.opencrabs/rsi/rejected/` so the trail is auditable.

A banner on session start shows the count of pending inbox items.

### Activity

A chronological feed of the last 100 RSI improvements. Shows what the autonomous engine did, when, and why:
- Brain file modifications (SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, etc.)
- Template syncs from upstream
- Hard rule additions
- Feedback analysis summaries
- Violation count updates

Each entry shows the time ago, a summary of the change, and the target file.

### Schedule

Your cron job queue with paused/active state. Each job shows:
- Job name
- Cron expression
- Next run time (when active)
- `paused` label (when paused)

See [Cron Jobs](./cron-jobs.md) for full cron documentation.

### Cron BLOB Recovery (v0.3.20)

Cron jobs with legacy `BLOB`-typed prompt rows in the database are now tolerated instead of causing silent failures. The schedule panel resumes showing jobs normally.

### Compaction Typing Without Banner (v0.3.22)

The visible compaction banner text has been removed. The schedule panel now uses typing-only indicators during compaction windows (10-60s), keeping the experience clean.

### Context Counter Evolution (v0.3.26→v0.3.28)

- **v0.3.26** — introduced per-provider tokenizer calibration. Uncalibrated providers showed `0/max` until first message calibrated the ratio
- **v0.3.28** — calibration system removed entirely. Context counter now uses provider-reported `input_tokens` verbatim, showing real-time usage without calibration overhead

## Keyboard Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus between panels (Inbox → Activity → Schedule) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move selection within a panel |
| `Enter` | Open detail popup for selected item |
| `a` | Apply selected inbox proposal |
| `r` | Reject selected inbox proposal |
| `Esc` | Close popup or exit Mission Control |

## Architecture

Mission Control is split into three module trees:

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Data services | `brain/mission_control/` | Fetches inbox proposals, activity log, schedule items |
| Panel renderers | `tui/render/mission_control/` | Draws each panel (inbox, activity, schedule, detail popup) |
| App state + input | `tui/app/mission_control/` | Focus management, keystroke handling, actions |

Layout and keystroke contracts are unit-testable without spinning up a full `App` instance.

## Analytics Panel (v0.3.78)

Mission Control gained a full **Analytics** view with its own database layer, event emitters, and responsive UI.

### What It Tracks

Every agent interaction emits analytics events to a dedicated SQLite table:

| Event Category | Examples |
|----------------|----------|
| **Phantom detection** | Detect/resolve events, false-positive rate |
| **Streaming** | Recovery count, tool_use per stream |
| **Brain verification** | Orient gate pass/reject, contradiction hits |
| **Model usage** | Active model per turn, provider switches |

### The Analytics UI

Open the analytics panel from Mission Control. It has:

- **Global time filter** — Day / Week / Month / All toggle at the top. All cards and tabs respect the selected window.
- **Responsive 3-across card grid** — summary cards (total events, phantom rate, streaming recoveries, brain verify hits) laid out in a 3-column grid that adapts to terminal width.
- **Model status icons** — each model row shows a health icon (green/yellow/red) based on recent success rate.
- **Tabbed detail panels** — Phantom / Model / D-W-M tabs with independent scroll. Each tab shows a ranked breakdown relevant to its category.

### Architecture

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `analytics_events` DB table | Append-only event store with category, model, timestamp |
| Event emitters | Wired across tool_loop, streaming, brain_verify, and provider paths |
| Query + report layer | Aggregation queries (counts, rates, top-N) with time-window filtering |
| TUI renderer | Card grid + tabbed scroll panels in Mission Control |
