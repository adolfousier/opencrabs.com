# Cron Jobs

Schedule tasks to run on a recurring schedule. Cron jobs can run in isolated sessions or wake the main session.

## CLI Management

```bash
# Add a job
opencrabs cron add \
  --name "Morning Report" \
  --cron "0 9 * * *" \
  --tz "Europe/London" \
  --prompt "Check emails, calendar, and give me a morning briefing" \
  --deliver-to telegram:123456

# List all jobs
opencrabs cron list

# Enable/disable (accepts name or ID)
opencrabs cron enable "Morning Report"
opencrabs cron disable "Morning Report"

# Remove (accepts name or ID)
opencrabs cron remove "Morning Report"
```

## Agent Management

The agent can also manage cron jobs via the `cron_manage` tool:

```
"Create a cron job that checks my emails every morning at 9am"
```

Since v0.3.80, `cron_manage` supports an **update action** that patches an existing job in place (#966) — change the schedule, prompt, model, or delivery target without deleting and recreating the job.

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--name` | Job name (unique identifier) |
| `--cron` | Cron expression (e.g. `0 9 * * *`) |
| `--tz` | Timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`) |
| `--prompt` | The prompt to send to the agent |
| `--provider` | AI provider to use (optional) |
| `--model` | Model to use (optional) |
| `--thinking` | Thinking mode: `on`, `off`, `budget_XXk` |
| `--deliver-to` | Channel delivery: `telegram:CHAT_ID`, `discord:CHANNEL_ID`, HTTP webhook URL, or comma-separated multiple targets |
| `--auto-approve` | Auto-approve tool use for this job |

## Multi-Target Delivery

`deliver_to` accepts comma-separated targets to send results to multiple destinations simultaneously:

```bash
opencrabs cron add \
  --name "Morning Report" \
  --cron "0 9 * * *" \
  --prompt "Give me a morning briefing" \
  --deliver-to "telegram:-12345,http://webhook.example.com/notify"
```

Supported targets in any combination:
- `telegram:CHAT_ID` or `telegram:-GROUP_ID`
- `discord:CHANNEL_ID`
- `slack:CHANNEL_ID`
- `whatsapp:PHONE_OR_JID`
- `http://...` or `https://...` (webhook URL)

### Target URLs (v0.5.1)

Since v0.5.1 every delivery field also speaks a unified `oc://` target scheme, resolved by a
central resolver against the live channel bindings (issue #148):

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `oc://telegram/<chat>[/<thread>]` | Telegram chat (optionally a forum topic) |
| `oc://discord/<channel>` | Discord channel |
| `oc://slack/<channel>` | Slack channel |
| `oc://whatsapp/<phone\|jid>` | WhatsApp contact |
| `oc://session/<uuid-or-prefix>` | Park the result in that OpenCrabs session's notify queue — the agent gets cron output the same way a sub-agent or a detached command reaches its parent (v0.5.1) |
| `here` | This conversation's channel (refused on headless surfaces, which have none) |

Target URLs are resolved **once, at create/update time**, and the concrete channel target is
baked into the job; if an unbaked URL ever reaches fire time the run fails loudly instead of
resolving against a possibly-changed world.

### Forum-topic delivery (v0.5.1, opt-in)

`telegram:CHAT_ID:THREAD_ID` (or the `oc://telegram/<chat>/<thread>` form) delivers into a
specific topic of a forum group. It is deliberately opt-in: the chat must actually be a
forum and the topic must exist — an invalid thread target is **rejected loudly at fire
time**, never silently re-routed to the general topic. When a job is created from inside a
thread (`here`/`oc://` form), the origin thread id is persisted so the result lands back in
the same topic (#104).

Results are stored in the DB via the `cron_results` table regardless of delivery target, so you can query past execution results with `opencrabs cron results <name>`.

## Scheduler Lock (v0.3.65)

The cron scheduler uses a **file lock** to prevent duplicate job execution. Only one scheduler instance can run per profile at a time. If you accidentally start OpenCrabs twice, the second instance won't fire duplicate cron jobs.

## Heartbeat vs Cron

**Use heartbeat (`HEARTBEAT.md`) when:**
- Checks are periodic but timing is flexible (~30 min)
- You want to reduce API calls by batching
- Tasks share the main session context

**Use cron when:**
- Exact timing matters ("9:00 AM every Monday")
- Task needs isolation from main session
- You want a different model or thinking level
- Output should deliver to a specific channel
