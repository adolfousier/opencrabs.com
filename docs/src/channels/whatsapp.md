# WhatsApp

Connect OpenCrabs to WhatsApp via QR code pairing.

## Setup

### Configure via the Onboarding Wizard

Run `/onboard:channels` (or `/onboard` and navigate to the Channels step):

1. Use `↑`/`↓` to focus **WhatsApp**
2. Press `Space` to toggle it on
3. Press `Enter` to open the WhatsApp setup screen
4. The setup screen has two fields:
   - **Connection** — shows the QR code or connection status
   - **Phone Allowlist** — comma-separated phone numbers in E.164 format (e.g. `+15551234567`). Leave empty to accept all messages.
5. When not yet paired, a **QR code** appears in the terminal:
   - Open WhatsApp on your phone → Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device
   - Scan the QR code
   - The status updates to "Connected" automatically
6. When already paired, press `R` on the Connection field to **reset** and re-pair
7. Press `Enter` to save

The pairing session persists across restarts — no need to re-scan.

### Manual Configuration (advanced)

```toml
# config.toml
[channels.whatsapp]
enabled = true
allowed_phones = ["+15551234567"]
```

## Configuration

WhatsApp options live under `[channels.whatsapp]` in `~/.opencrabs/config.toml`:

```toml
[channels.whatsapp]
enabled = true
allowed_phones = ["+15551234567"]      # E.164 format
session_idle_hours = 24.0              # idle timeout for non-owner sessions
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable the WhatsApp channel |
| `allowed_phones` | `[]` (open replies under `auto`, but **never** owner rights) | E.164 phone numbers. Since v0.5.1 an empty list no longer makes every sender the bot owner — owner commands (`/evolve`, `/rebuild`, `/exit`, `/cd`) and approval answers need the self-chat, `bot_owner`, or the resolver over `bot_owner` + `allowed_phones` |
| `session_idle_hours` | `None` (no timeout) | Idle timeout for non-owner sessions. Owner sessions never expire |
| `response_policy` | `"auto"` | Who the bot responds to. `auto`: reply to all while there is at most one active sender, then switch to mention-only once a second unique sender appears. `owner_only`: only the bot owner. `allowlist`: only allowed phones. `open`: everyone |
| `bot_owner` | `None` (auto-seeded from `allowed_phones[0]`) | Phone number of the bot owner in E.164 format. The owner gets access that other allowlisted users do not. Commands that expose personal data or the host system are owner-only |

## How it works

**One account per instance.** Each OpenCrabs instance supports one WhatsApp account (one companion device). You run the bot AS whatever account you scan: your own number (talk via "Message Yourself"), or any other number you own, including a WhatsApp Business account.

**The bot talks to itself.** If you message the bot's own paired number, the bot replies to you. This is by design. The paired account's self-chat is always allowed, regardless of `response_policy` or `allowed_phones`.

**Allowlist behavior.** Anyone messaging the paired number who is on the `allowed_phones`
list gets a reply. The `response_policy` controls who else can interact beyond the allowlist.

**Ownership (v0.5.1, deny-by-default).** Before v0.5.1 an empty `allowed_phones` under
`response_policy = "auto"` answered every contact *and* elevated them all to owner — one
forgotten allowlist away from handing strangers `/evolve` and `/cd`. That elevation is gone:
being answered no longer means being in charge. Owner status comes from the paired
account's self-chat, a configured `bot_owner`, or ownership resolution over
`allowed_phones` + `bot_owner` — never from an empty list. Tool-approval replies
(Yes/Always/No/YOLO) resolve only for the owner on all four channels.


- **Personal and group chats** — Works in DMs and group conversations
- **Image support** — Send and receive images
- **Voice messages** — STT transcription + TTS response
- **Plain text UI** — No buttons (WhatsApp limitation), uses text-based menus
- **Slash commands** — All built-in and custom commands work

## Outbound rate limiting

WhatsApp is the channel with the heaviest ban consequences, so every outbound send goes
through a budget (since v0.5.1):

```toml
[channels.whatsapp.rate_limit]
messages_per_minute = 30   # token bucket: sustained sends per minute
daily_cap = 800            # rolling 24h hard cap
```

| Mechanism | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Per-minute pacing** | A token bucket sized to `messages_per_minute` (default 30) refills continuously. An over-budget send is **paced**, not dropped: the caller sleeps for the refill gap and then sends. Set `0` to disable pacing. |
| **Rolling daily cap** | The 24h window allows `daily_cap` sends (default 800). On saturation further sends park in a FIFO queue; a background drainer flushes them as the window slides. A queued quote-reply loses its quote context — the text still arrives. Set `0` to disable the cap. |
| **Owner alert** | The first send queued in a saturation episode alerts the bot owner exactly once (through the WhatsApp session), and the alert re-arms when traffic drops back under the cap. |
| **Owner bypass** | Messages addressed to the owner skip budget consumption entirely, so you always get fast replies; the saturation alert itself is also exempt. |

Streaming answers used to post every chunk as its own message — exactly the volume pattern
Meta's heuristics hunt. Outbound replies now edit one message in place (since v0.5.1), which
keeps chunked turns well inside the budget; the limiter is the safety net underneath.

## Formatting Notes

- No markdown tables — use bullet lists
- No headers — use **bold** or CAPS for emphasis
- Links render natively

## Voice Message Handling

When receiving a voice message:
1. Agent downloads and transcribes via STT
2. Sends text response first (searchable)
3. Optionally generates TTS audio response

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong number replying

Each OpenCrabs instance supports one WhatsApp account (one companion device). If you connected multiple numbers or the wrong number is replying, you need a full reset. The bot always uses the last number you connected.

> **Critical:** Always reset the connection before connecting a new number. OpenCrabs only keeps the last paired number.

**Full reset steps:**

1. **Remove ALL linked devices from WhatsApp.** Open WhatsApp on your phone, go to **Settings > Linked Devices**, and remove every device in the list. Don't bother hunting for the `opencrabs` one. A stale device left over from an earlier pairing is the usual reason the old number keeps replying, so the reliable fix is to clear them all and start fresh.
2. **Reset the connection in OpenCrabs** — in the TUI or from a channel, go to `/onboard:channels` and press **R** to reset the WhatsApp connection. Wait for confirmation that the reset is complete.
3. **Re-pair from scratch** — after the reset is confirmed, go to WhatsApp > **Settings > Linked Devices** > **Link a Device** and scan the new QR code shown by OpenCrabs.

If the bot still shows the old number after resetting, make sure you completed step 1 (removing the device from WhatsApp) before step 2.

### Common issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Old number still replying | A stale linked device is still paired | Remove **ALL** linked devices from WhatsApp > Settings > Linked Devices, then press **R** in `/onboard:channels` and re-pair |
| QR code doesn't appear | Agent is still connected (no restart triggered) | Press **R** in `/onboard:channels` to force a restart, then wait for the new QR |
| Bot doesn't reply to anyone | `response_policy` is too restrictive | Set `response_policy = "allowlist"` and add phone numbers to `allowed_phones` in `config.toml` |
| Bot replies to everyone | `response_policy` is `open` | Set `response_policy = "allowlist"` or `"owner_only"` in `config.toml` |
| Bot doesn't reply to self-chat | `allowed_phones` doesn't include the paired number | The paired number's self-chat is always allowed, regardless of `allowed_phones`. If it's not working, check that `response_policy` isn't too restrictive |
